Cpoding ahs always fekt boring for me , i never felt inpired or moved by anything. But this all changed once i got introduced to open ai api. It enabled me to create my own ai agent which i could communicate with, the goal of this project was to learn and practice some more coding whilst also doign something which i found passionate hence the whole jarvis concept

make sure to have all the librairies and drivers installed and create an api key which can be done in the open ai website 

to activate the trasncribe mode type s and then enter, the ai will be lsitening to you up until the moment you stop speaking which it will be able to recognize by itself

! note: the transcribe  migth not work on all devices as i have specifically structured it to work on my macbook, so the library might be slightly limiting
